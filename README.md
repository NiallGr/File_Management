### Sprint 3 (Week 5-6)
- User Test
- Fixes Bugs

**Issues:**  
When the application was distributed to testers, errors arose where files could not be found as the directory where they where stored was not to be found on the testers computers. 
**Amendment:** "If, Else" Statement was added to add the necessary path requirements if they were not present on the user's system.
